/** Tutorial 08

INTRODUCTION:

In this week's tutorial you will be working with the TCA0 and
ADC0 peripherals. You will use these to control the brightness
of the 7-segment display, produce a tone from the buzzer, and
read the position of the potentiometer.

Interfacing with these hardware devices on the QUTy is a core
requirement for Assessment 2.
*/

/** EX: 8.0

TASK: Write a function named "pwm_init" which will configure
TCA0 to produce a

    3X0 Hz, 1Y % duty cycle output on the DISP EN net.

Where XY are the last two digits of your student number.

Your function should take no arguments and return no values.

EXAMPLE: If your student number were n12345678 then
you should configure TCA0 to produce a

    370 Hz, 18 % duty cycle output.

/**
 * pwm_init function initializes PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) settings,
 *  configuring a timer and its associated pins to generate a PWM signal.
 *  It sets the timer's frequency, duty cycle, and enables PWM output on specific pins.
*/

//my student number: n11507365 --> X=6, and Y=5. --->  360 Hz, 15 % duty cycle output on the DISP EN net.

/*
Formula for PWM Frequency:
--------------------------
f_PWM = 1 / (TOP * T_clk_timer)

Where:
- f_PWM is the desired PWM frequency in Hertz (Hz).
- TOP is the value to which the timer counts.
- T_clk_timer is the time period of the timer clock in seconds (s).

To set a PWM frequency of 360 Hz with a timer clock period of 3.3333e-6 s,
TOP should be calculated as follows:
TOP = 1 / (f_PWM * T_clk_timer)
    = 1 / (360 * 3.3333e-6)
    â‰ˆ 8333    ---->  but I had to use 9250  <-----

Formula for PWM Duty Cycle:
---------------------------
CMPx = TOP * (duty_cycle / 100)

Where:
- CMPx is the compare match value.
- TOP is the value to which the timer counts.
- duty_cycle is the desired duty cycle in percentage (%).

To set a duty cycle of 15% with a TOP value of 9250,
CMPx should be calculated as follows:
CMPx = TOP * (duty_cycle / 100)
     = 9250 * (15 / 100)
     = 1387.5

        TASK: Write code below such that the position of the potentiometer
        controls the brightness of the 7-segment display in reverse.

        The display should be:
        - fully bright when the potentiometer is turned fully counter-clockwise
        - fully dim when the potentiometer is turned fully clockwise

        NOTE: ADC0.RESULT yields a value of 0 when the potentiometer is turned
        fully counter-clockwise, and a value of 255 when turned fully clockwise.

        You will need to reverse this range of values using a mathematical
        expression to achieve the desired functionality.

        HINT:

        1. Scale the 8-bit value from ADC0.RESULT to a value between
           0 and the TOP value of TCA0.
        2. Reverse the direction of the potentiometer by subtracting the
           scaled value from the TOP value of TCA0.

        Alternatively,

        1. Reverse the direction of the potentiometer by subtracting the
           8-bit value from ADC0.RESULT from 255.
        2. Scale the reversed value to a value between 0 and the TOP
           value of TCA0.

        TIP: Avoid floating-point arithmetic by performing integer operations.
        To ensure that you do not encounter integer overflow and loss of precision,
        perform operations in an appropriate order.

        TASK: Write code below such that the buzzer produces a 360 Hz tone
        when the potentiometer position is between 87.5% and 100%, where
        0% is fully CCW and 100% is fully CW.

        When the pot position is outside of this range the buzzer should be silent.

        The buzzer should be driven with a
        - 50 % duty cycle square wave when active
        - 0 % duty cycle square wave when inactive

        TIP: You will need to modify the code in pwm_init() to achieve this functionality.
